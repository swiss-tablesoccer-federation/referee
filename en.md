# Become a referee

> Attention: All translations were done with DeepL. If anything can be optimized, please report it to referee@swisstablesoccer.ch.

We are very pleased that you are interested in becoming a Swiss Tablesoccer Federation referee. The entire process is defined in the refereeing concept.

In a nutshell, the training is structured as follows:

1. Read the rules «[Standard Matchplay Rules 2024](./docs/Standard_Matchplay_Rules_2024.pdf)» and the [rule interpretations STF](./docs/Regelinterpretationen%20STF.pdf)
2. Optional: Join the [WhatsApp group](./contact.md) and take part in the discussions
3. Register for our online training tool via the following link: [Registration training tool Micromate](https://learn.micromate.ai/registration?orgCode=8955-DEF2-BAF2-F4B1)
    1. Important: Use your full name and the email address that you use to access the STF player profile.
3. Confirm your account via the email you receive from Micromate.
4. Register with Micromate via the following link and start your training.
    1. You can find the training tool here: [Training tool Micromate](https://learn.micromate.ai)
    2. Micromate will conduct a kind of conversation with you. He will ask you rules questions in small sessions of 5 questions. Micromate will recognize what you can and cannot do. He will ask you the same questions again over time to check your progress. It is best to study for 10 minutes each day to achieve the necessary percentage sustainably.
6. Save the above link, you will need it often in the next few months.
7. As soon as you have achieved the [learning objective](https://referee.swisstablesoccer.ch/#lernziele) for “Assistant”, you can register for a training course.
8. As soon as you have completed the training course, you will automatically be promoted to “Regional”.
9. Gain experience at the tournaments (see practical training section)
10. Achieve the [learning objective](https://referee.swisstablesoccer.ch/#lernziele) for the “National” level
11. Contact the Referee Commission to request promotion to “National”.

Please refer to the “Annual Recognition” section to ensure that your referee status does not expire.

Do you have questions about the training? Then join our [WhatsApp group](./contact.md).

## Theoretical training

- The questions are asked in the language you have selected.
All technical terms are always in English. This is to simplify communication between referees and players, even if the parties speak different languages.
We are constantly improving the theory training. This means that it is quite possible that you will still come across errors. Please report them directly using the [Micromate feedback function](./feedback.md).

### Learning packages
The learning content in Micromate is divided into two learning packages. It's best to start with “Definitions”. This is about understanding the most important terms in foosball, e.g. what a “transfer” or a “transition” is. In the second learning package, “Interpretations”, you will learn to apply the rules based on game situations.

### Learning objectives
The following learning objectives must be achieved in Micromate for each learning package at each referee level:

|Level|Learning package Definitions|Learning package Interpretations|
|---|---|---|
|Assistant|40%|40%|
|National|80%|80%|

## Practical training

As soon as you have completed the first part of the theoretical training with Micromate, you will have the opportunity to further your education in practice by taking part in tournaments and one of our referee workshops.

You have the following options for practical training at tournaments:

- Whistling games as a passive referee
- Whistling games together with a referee coach.

Important: As a passive referee, you can take on games at any time from the Assistant level onwards. However, please note that even entering a game can have an impact on the game. If possible, try to avoid entering and exiting games that are already in progress. (e.g. be involved in a match from the start and make sure you are not called up for a game yourself during the match).

## Referee workshops

We conduct three workshops a year. The workshops have the following conditions:

- At least 3 participants
- Maximum 15 participants
- When registering, “first-come first-serve” applies.
- Workshops are free of charge for participants
- Take place on a Saturday or Sunday
- Each lasts about 6 hours
- Unexcused absence will be punished with a 2-year ban from further workshops

If you would like to organize a specific referee workshop for your club, we would be happy to help. Please contact us at [referee@swisstablesoccer.ch](mailto:referee@swisstablesoccer.ch).

We are currently planning the next workshop dates. As soon as they are known, you will be able to register for them here.

## Annual recognition

Forgetting can be a blessing, but in the field of referee training, it is more of a curse. We humans forget what we have learned. Sometimes faster, sometimes slower. However, to be a good referee, it is essential that the basics are still there even five years after the training.

Therefore, you have to achieve the necessary learning objectives for your level every year in order to be listed accordingly. The classification is always updated every six months and is valid for one year. The deadlines are:

- 30.06.20XX
- 31.12.20XX

In order to receive the necessary award on the corresponding cut-off date, you must have achieved the learning objective at least once in Micromate within 6 months prior to the cut-off date. Whether you can demonstrate the necessary percentage figures on the cut-off date is irrelevant.

> Tip: You will remember what you have learned for longer if you complete small learning units frequently. It is best to study with Micromate for 5-10 minutes a day to achieve your learning goal.

## Steering levy

As defined in the referee training concept, a steering fee of up to CHF 30 is due for players who have not completed the referee training. This is automatically added to the annual license.

Depending on your level of training, you will be waived this amount:

- Without training: 30.- CHF
- Assistant: 10.- CHF
- Regional: 0.- CHF
- National: 0.- CHF

## Frequently asked questions

- I was at 80 percent two weeks ago, but now only at 62% - why is my learning progress declining?
    - We humans forget, and we do it quickly. Micromate recognizes this and recognizes you accordingly after a learning break. If you learn more over a longer period of time, this process will slow down noticeably. Furthermore, your learning progress will quickly recover if Micromate recognizes that you still have a good grasp of the content.
- Where can I find my learning progress per learning package?
    - You can view your personal learning progress at any time in the Learning Progress tab at Micromate.
- Would a guided practical training not be more sensible? For example, with workshops, rule discussions, etc.?
    - We are convinced that practical training such as in our training courses is only useful if the participants have understood the basics of the rules. Accordingly, the basis of our training is a basic theoretical training on which the practical training is built.
- My access to Micromate is not working, what can I do?
    - Contact us at <referee@swisstablesoccer.ch>.
- I have achieved the learning objectives but have not yet received a confirmation. What should I do?
    - You will receive the confirmation on the next due date. If you have not received a confirmation by email one week after the due date, contact us at <referee@swisstablesoccer.ch>.
- Can I be promoted directly to national?
    - Yes, if you bring the theory part up to the required level in the first year and attend the training course, you can be promoted directly to “national”.
- I found a mistake in the training, where can I report it?
    - Contact us in our [WhatsApp group or at referee@swisstablesoccer.ch](./contact.md).
- What are the requirements for the Referee Commission to promote a candidate to “National”?
    - In principle, a referee must decide for themselves whether they feel comfortable enough to take full responsibility for a game. However, the Referee Commission expects referees to be able to demonstrate a certain level of experience.
- Where can I get the rules in German/French/Italian?
    - The rules are currently only available in English. A translation would have to be provided by the ITSF.
- Why do I have to learn the same thing every year?
    - Are you sure you still know everything? Then the questions should be a breeze for you. However, we will also continuously add new questions to ensure that you as a referee always have up-to-date knowledge.
- Who can take the umpire training?
     - The theory training with Micromate and the practical training at our workshops are only open to players who belong to a club affiliated with the STF.
